# Reverse Image Search
Reverse image search is how most images will be sauced.
<br>General purpose reverse image search:
<br>[yandex][1]
<br>[google][2]
<br>[bing][3]
<br>[tineye][4]
<br>[google lens][5]
<br>Yandex usually wins here. BE SURE TO ENABLE NSFW RESULTS! [yandex tune page][17] They hid the option recently.
<br>Google lens is more fuzzy than google's regular reverse image search, and can return good results.
<br>Google lens filters out porn results.
<br>Google lens is strangely good at finding the location an image was taken. They put special effort into it being able to identify "landmarks".



Niche reverse image search:
<br>[iqdb][6] indexes boorus
<br>[trace.moe][7] indexes anime
<br>[saucenao][8] indexes anime, boorus, etc [(index list)][10]
<br>[ascii2d][9] indexes twitter/pixiv
<br>[karmadecay][11] indexes reddit
<br>[repostsleut][12] indexes reddit
<br>[pimeyes][18] creepy facial recognition site (paid)



# File Name
File names can often contain the sauce.

Filenames known to contain sauce:
<br>Pixiv: 648001_p0.jpg -> [https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=648001](https://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=648001)
<br>Flickr: 4440449458_e6b8785d46_o.jpg -> [https://flickr.com/photo.gne?id=4440449458](https://flickr.com/photo.gne?id=4440449458)
<br>Imgur: GE6hNEO.jpg -> [https://imgur.com/GE6hNEO](https://imgur.com/GE6hNEO)
<br>Facebook: 12015056_717897598316401_603470361027771303_o.jpg -> [https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=717897598316401](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=717897598316401) (only works with older images)
<br>Note: Most of these are included in [4chan-x's sauce settings][13] along with RegEx for them.

Google the file name. Image search returns different results than regular search.
<br>[https://www.google.com/search?q=FR6QXxmVcAAb9Gy.jpg&tbm=isch](https://www.google.com/search?q=FR6QXxmVcAAb9Gy.jpg&tbm=isch)
<br>This also works for image URLs.



# Hashes
Hashes can be searched on some sites, like boorus.
<br>For example, [danbooru MD5][14], [4chan archives][15] ([list of 4chan archives][16])

# Other
If you got the image from 4chan, be sure to search for it's filename and hash in the [archives][16].
<br>The initial post and subsequent posts are likely to contain the sauce. Try searching again if you find different filenames while hash searching.

Search text from the image!

Google does OCR on the images and returns relevant results if you search in the image tab.
<br>Google likes to hide NSFW results unless you include something specific, like "doujin" if it's obviously a doujin page.
<br>Some other sites OCR images and return in the regular search.
<br>Sometimes people quote the image.

If you get a slightly less cropped image but not the sauce, always search the bigger image again.
